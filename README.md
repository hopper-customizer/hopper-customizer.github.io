Welcome to the Hopper Customizer's GitHub page! This project (website located at https://hopper-customizer.github.io/) allows you to customize your own Pet Grasshopper as seen in the game [Animal Jam Classic](https://classic.animaljam.com/en) (AJC). (Note: this website does not create a hopper in-game, but allows you to see what it would look like.)

# Preview
![Preview](https://github.com/hopper-customizer/hopper-customizer.github.io/blob/main/misc_assets/hopper%20customizer%20preview.gif)

# Features
* Completely free!
* Fully customizable, no restrictions
* No lag time when selecting features
* High quality source files
* Accurate renditions of hoppers seen in-game
* Ability to save your hopper as a .png file with transparent background
* Ability to open the hopper's image in a new tab to look closer

# Notes
* Safe to use: your data is not stored anywhere; website requires no AJC account information
* Website has been optimized to fit best on desktop screens 
* Cannot zoom in by usual means: please utilize the "new tab" functionality (this has been done so the website can maintain proportions)
* Intended for use in Chrome, may not work in other browsers

# Support
Have any questions, need help, or spot a bug? (No, not the grasshopper kind!) Feel free to [send me a message](https://aj-item-worth.fandom.com/wiki/Message_Wall:BrightSunshine) on the Animal Jam Item Worth Wiki (AJIWW). I am not actively monitoring this GitHub account.
